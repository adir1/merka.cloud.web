# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Core Concepts

- Retrieval Component
- Generation Component
- Knowledge Base
- Query Processing

## Popular RAG Techniques
- Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR)
- BM25 (Okapi BM25)
- ColBERT (Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT)
- FiD (Fusion-in-Decoder)
- Hybrid Retrieval (combining dense and sparse methods)

## Applications
- Open-Domain Question Answering
- Conversational AI
- Summarization with Retrieval Support
- Document-Based Information Retrieval
- Knowledge-Enhanced Chatbots

## Key Models
- BART-RAG (BART combined with retrieval for better responses)
- T5-RAG (T5 model augmented with a retrieval step)
- GPT-RAG (GPT with integrated retrieval capabilities)

## Challenges
- Latency (Balancing retrieval speed and response generation)
- Memory and Compute Constraints
- Managing Large Knowledge Bases
- Relevance of Retrieved Information
- Combining Multiple Retrieved Passages

## Advantages
- Increased Accuracy via Knowledge Retrieval
- Handling of Long-Tail Queries
- Dynamic Knowledge Inference
- Avoiding Hallucinations in Generation

## Tools & Libraries
- Hugging Face Transformers (BART-RAG, DPR)
- Pyserini (BM25)
- FAISS (Efficient similarity search for dense vectors)
- Haystack (Open-source NLP framework for RAG-based models)

## Future Directions
- Improved Dense and Hybrid Retrieval Models
- Multimodal RAG (Integrating text, images, and other data types)
- Efficient RAG for Low-Resource Devices
- Real-Time Retrieval for Conversational AI
